Basically nodejs : allows to run JS on computer, earlier we ran using browser on html file

What is node js?Backend technology


Why nodejs? create Backend using JS
	      node is super fast 

Uber,ebay,twitter,netflix all use NodeJS

A server has to interact with computer to get files, Node JS helps with that
Browser JS cannot interact with computer  directly
What node does?
	Helps JS interact directly with computer hardware
	//can write js code on browser + computer
	where we wrote JS code earlier? Browser (interacts with browser/does evreything with browser)
	Our browser js cannot access computer
	Code cannot reach user computer and gain access to file system etc (except for Desktop applications ; where access to file system is needed)

node js can run code 
	1) on our computer
	2) Server
