What is inside node? Built in modules
Check documentations

What native modules?
//nodejs.org/api

Ex FileSystem, DNS,Crypto,ECMAScriptModules etc



How to use native modules? require() method
	File System module documentation
	->	
		const fs = require('fs');	//fs can be named anything

	If error : const avail only with latest avail version of js es6
		//write comment as below
		->//jshint es version:6	//tells linter that using es6
		

What is difference var vs const?
//Can change value in var
var a=2; 
a = 5;

//Cannot change value of const //Why use? create container that are not going to be changed / meddled with ex pi
const a =2;
a = 5;



Ex of node use
use JS to make changes in computer

index.js
const fs = require("fs");
fs.copyFileSync("file1.txt", "file2.txt")	//checks current directory-> copies it to new file2.txt if doesnt exist

Save -> HyperTerminal -> //in same directory node index.js
//Check file is created
